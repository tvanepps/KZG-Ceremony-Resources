## Summary

The KZG Ceremony is a coordinated public ritual (aka trusted setup, "Parameter Generation Event" in Zcash) which will provide a cryptographic foundation for Ethereum scaling initiatives. From the specs repo:

> The ceremony takes place between participants and the sequencer. Participants are the entities that contribute their secret randomness to the final output 𝜏 s. The roll of the sequencer it to act as the common point of interaction for all participants as well as verifying participants' contribution as the ceremony progresses.

The ceremony is designed to have the following characteristics:

- wide ecosystem participation
- accessible via browser
- a meaningful narrative in a simple interface 
- easy to audit transcript

The best place to follow along is the KZG Ceremony channel in the [Ethereum R&D Discord](https://discord.gg/bZrptf6Est) or the bridged [telegram channel](https://t.me/+OvdstAcYZ09mMWMx).
